"""Project Euler Problem 06

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1 ** 2 + 2 ** 2 + ... + 10 ** 2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10) ** 2 = 55 ** 2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
